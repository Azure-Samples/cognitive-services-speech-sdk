# Sample Repository for the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK

This project hosts the **samples** for the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK. To find out more about the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK itself, please visit the [SDK documentation site](https://aka.ms/csspeech).

## News

Please check [here](https://aka.ms/csspeech/whatsnew) for release notes and older releases.

## Features

This repository hosts samples that help you to get started with several features of the SDK.
In addition more complex scenarios are included to give you a head-start on using speech technology in your application.

We tested the samples with the latest released version of the SDK on Windows 10, Linux (on [supported Linux distributions and target architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk?tabs=linux)), Android devices (API 23: Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher), Mac x64 (OS version 10.14 or higher) and Mac M1 arm64 (OS version 11.0 or higher) and iOS 11.4 devices.

## Getting Started

The [SDK documentation](https://aka.ms/csspeech) has extensive sections about getting started, setting up the SDK, as well as the process to acquire the required subscription keys. You will need subscription keys to run the samples on your machines, you therefore should follow the instructions on these pages before continuing.

## Get the samples

* The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the current version as a [ZIP file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/archive/master.zip).

  * On Windows, before you unzip the archive, right-click it, select **Properties**, and then select **Unblock**.
  * Be sure to unzip the entire archive, and not just individual samples.

* Clone this sample repository using a Git client.

## Build and run the samples

> **Note: the samples make use of the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK.
> By downloading the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK, you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license201809).**

Please see the description of each individual sample for instructions on how to build and run it.
