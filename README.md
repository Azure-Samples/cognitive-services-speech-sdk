# Sample Repository for the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK

This project hosts the **samples** for the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK (Preview). To find out more about the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK itself, please visit the [SDK documentation site](https://aka.ms/csspeech).

## Features

This repository hosts samples that help you to get started with several features of the SDK.
In addition more complex scenarios are included to give you a head-start on using speech technology in your application.

We tested the samples with the latest released version of the SDK (0.5.0) on the Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04, and ARM-based Android devices (API 23: Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher).

## Getting Started

The [SDK documentation](https://aka.ms/csspeech) has extensive sections about getting started, setting up the SDK, as well as the process to acquire the required subscription keys. You will need subscription keys to run the samples on your machines, you therefore should follow the instructions on these pages before continuing.

## Get the samples

* The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the current version as a [ZIP file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/archive/master.zip).

  * On Windows, before you unzip the archive, right-click it, select **Properties**, and then select **Unblock**.
  * Be sure to unzip the entire archive, and not just individual samples.

* Clone this sample repository using a Git client.

## Build and run the samples

> **Note: the samples make use of the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK.
> By downloading the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK, you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/license).**

### Windows

All Windows samples require a working installation of [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/) on your system, Community edition or higher.
When you compile the samples inside Visual Studio, the required Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK components will be automatically downloaded from [nuget.org](https://aka.ms/nuget).

### Linux (Ubuntu 16.04)

Our Linux sample is based on our Linux binary download (`https://aka.ms/csspeech/linuxbinary`).
Instructions to build are included in the sample's README.

### Android

All Android samples require a working installation of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/).
They make use of the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK for Android Maven package (`com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech:client-sdk`) that is hosted under `https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/`.
At this time, we support ARM-based Android devices (API 23: Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher).

## Overview of samples

Our quickstarts for various platforms demonstrates how to do one-shot speech recognition from microphone.
If you want to build them from scratch, please follow the articles in the Quickstart section on our [documentation page](https://aka.ms/csspeech).
