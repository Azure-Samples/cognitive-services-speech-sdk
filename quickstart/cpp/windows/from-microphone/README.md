This sample demonstrates how to recognize speech with C++ using the Speech SDK for Windows.
See the [accompanying article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstarts/speech-to-text-from-microphone?tabs=dotnet%2Cx-android%2CWindows%2Cjava-runtime%2Cwindowsinstall&pivots=programming-language-cpp) on the SDK documentation page which describes how to build this sample from scratch in Visual Studio 2019.

## Prerequisites

* A Windows PC with a working microphone.
* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/), Community Edition or higher.
* The **Desktop development with C++** workload in Visual Studio and the **NuGet package manager** component in Visual Studio.
  You can enable both in **Tools** \> **Get Tools and Features**, under the **Workloads** and **Individual components** tabs, respectively.
