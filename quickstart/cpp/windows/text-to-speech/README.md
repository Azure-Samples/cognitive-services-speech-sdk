# Quickstart: Synthesize speech in C++ for Windows

This sample demonstrates how to synthesize speech with C++ using the Speech SDK for Windows.
See the [accompanying article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started-text-to-speech?tabs=terminal&pivots=programming-language-cpp) on the SDK documentation page which describes how to build this sample from scratch in Visual Studio 2019.

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
* A Windows PC with a working speaker or headset.
* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/), Community Edition or higher.
* The **Desktop development with C++** workload in Visual Studio and the **NuGet package manager** component in Visual Studio.
  You can enable both in **Tools** \> **Get Tools and Features**, under the **Workloads** and **Individual components** tabs, respectively.
