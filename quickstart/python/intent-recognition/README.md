# Quickstart: Using the Speech Service from Python

This sample shows how to use the Speech Service through the Speech SDK for Python. It illustrates how the SDK can be used to recognize speech from microphone input.

See the [accompanying article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstarts/speech-to-text-from-microphone?tabs=dotnet%2Cx-android%2Clinux%2Cjava-runtime%2Cwindowsinstall&pivots=programming-language-python) on the SDK documentation page for step-by-step instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, here's a list of prerequisites:

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
* See the [Speech SDK installation quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform?pivots=programming-language-python) for details on system requirements and setup.

## Get the Speech SDK Python Package

**By downloading the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK, you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license).**

The Cognitive Services Speech SDK Python package can be installed from [pyPI](https://pypi.org/) using this command:

```sh
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech
```

## Run the sample

Before you run the sample code, replace the dummy values `YourSubscriptionKey` and `YourServiceRegion` by your subscription information.
You can either load the quickstart sample in your IDE and run it there or run it in a console by navigating to the directory you downloaded it to and running the command

```sh
python quickstart.py
```

Alternatively, you can run the sample `quickstart.ipynb` as a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) file.
