# Quickstart: Translate speech in C# for .NET Core on Windows or Linux

This sample demonstrates how to translate speech with C# under .NET 8.0 (Windows or Linux) using the Speech SDK.
See the [accompanying article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started-speech-translation?tabs=script%2Cwindowsinstall&pivots=programming-language-csharp) on the SDK documentation page which describes how to build this sample from scratch in Visual Studio.

> **Note:**
> We currently only support [specific Linux distributions and target architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk?tabs=linux).

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
* A PC (Windows, Linux, Mac) with a working microphone. See the [Speech SDK installation quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform?pivots=programming-language-csharp) for details on system requirements and setup.

## Build the sample

* **By building this sample you will download the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK. By downloading you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license).**
* [Download the sample code to your development PC.](/README.md#get-the-samples)

* If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows:
  * Start Microsoft Visual Studio and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
  * Navigate to the folder containing this sample, and select the solution file contained within it.
* Edit the `Program.cs` source:
  * Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your own subscription key.
  * Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the service region of your subscription.
    For example, replace with `westus` if you are using the 30-day free trial subscription.
* If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows, press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.
* If you are using the .NET Core CLI, run the following command from the directory that contains this sample:

  ```bash
  dotnet build helloworld/helloworld.csproj
  ```

## Run the sample
