# Quickstart: Recognize speech in C# under .NET Core (Windows or Linux)

This sample demonstrates how to recognize speech with C# under .NET Core 2.0 (Windows or Linux) using the Speech SDK.
See the [accompanying article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstart-cpp-dotnetcore-windows) on the SDK documentation page which describes how to build this sample from scratch in Visual Studio 2017.

> **Note:**
> on Linux, we currently only support the Ubuntu 16.04 x64 distribution.

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
* A PC (Windows x64, Ubuntu 16.04 x64) with a working microphone.
* Either one of the following:
  * On Windows:
    * [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/), Community Edition or higher.
    * The **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload in Visual Studio.
      You can enable it in **Tools** \> **Get Tools and Features**.
  * On Windows or Linux (Ubuntu 16.04):
    * [.NET Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.0)
    * On Windows you also need the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) for your platform.
* On Ubuntu 16.04, run the following commands for the installation of required packages:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl1.0.0 libcurl3 libasound2 wget
  ```

## Build the sample

* **By building this sample you will download the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK. By downloading you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license201809).**
* [Download the sample code to your development PC.](../../README.md#get-the-samples)

* If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 on Windows:
  * Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
  * Navigate to the folder containing this sample, and select the solution file contained within it.
* Edit the `Program.cs` source:
  * Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your own subscription key.
  * Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the service region of your subscription.
    For example, replace with `westus` if you are using the 30-day free trial subscription.
* If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 on Windows, press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.
* If you are using the .NET Core CLI, run the following command from the directory that contains this sample:

  ```bash
  dotnet build helloworld/helloworld.csproj
  ```

## Run the sample
