# Quickstart: Synthesize audio in Objective-C on macOS using the Speech SDK

This sample demonstrates how to create a macOS app in Objective-C using the Cognitive Services Speech SDK to synthesize audio from text input.

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
* A macOS machine with [Xcode](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) version 9.4.1 or later and macOS 10.13 or later.

## Get the Code for the Sample App

* [Download the sample code to your development PC.](../../../README.md#get-the-samples)

## Get the Speech SDK for macOS

**By downloading the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK, you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license201809).**

The Cognitive Services Speech SDK for Mac is distributed as a framework bundle.
It can be used in Xcode projects as a [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/), or downloaded directly [here](https://aka.ms/csspeech/macosbinary) and linked manually. This guide uses a CocoaPod.

## Install the SDK as a CocoaPod

1. Install the CocoaPod dependency manager as described in its [installation instructions](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
1. Navigate to the directory of the downloaded sample app (`helloworld`) in a terminal. 
1. Run the command `pod install`. This will generate a `helloworld.xcworkspace` Xcode workspace containing both the sample app and the Speech SDK as a dependency. This workspace will be used in the following.

## Build and Run the Sample

1. Open the `helloworld.xcworkspace` workspace in Xcode.
1. Make the following changes in the `AppDelegate.m` file:
    1. Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/regions) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).
1. Make the debug output visible (**View** > **Debug Area** > **Activate Console**).
1. Build and run the example code by selecting **Product** -> **Run** from the menu or clicking the **Play** button.
1. After you input some text and click the button in the app, you should hear the synthesized audio played.
