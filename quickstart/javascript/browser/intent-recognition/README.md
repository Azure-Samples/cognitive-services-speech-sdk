# Quickstart: Using the Speech Service to Recognize intent in JavaScript on a Web Browser.

This sample shows how to recognize intent with the Speech Service using the Speech SDK for JavaScript on a web browser, like Microsoft Edge, or Chrome. It illustrates how the SDK can be used to translate speech in one language to text in a different language.

* See the [overview article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/intent-recognition) on the SDK documentation page to learn more about intent recognition using the Speech Service.

## Prerequisites

* A LUIS account. You can get one for free through the [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai/home).
* A new or existing LUIS app - [create LUIS app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstarts/intent-recognition#create-a-luis-app-for-intent-recognition)
* A PC or Mac, with a working microphone.
* A text editor.
* Optionally, a web server that supports hosting PHP scripts.

## Build the sample

* **By downloading the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK when building this sample, you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/license).**
* [Download the sample code to your development PC.](/README.md#get-the-samples)

If you want to host the sample on a web server:

* Deploy all files to your web server.
* IMPORTANT: Never add a subscription key to client-side code. For advanced guidance on keeping sensitive subscription info secure, see the [sample using a server-side auth token](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/js/browser)

## Run the `index.html` sample

* In case you are running the sample from your local computer, open `index.html` from the location where you have downloaded this quickstart with a JavaScript capable browser.
* To run this sample, you will need to create or use an existing LUIS app - [create LUIS app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstarts/intent-recognition#create-a-luis-app-for-intent-recognition)
* Use the input fields to set your `LUIS Primary key` and `LUIS Location`.
* From the LUIS app portal, in the Manage menu, copy the App ID from the Application Settings screen into the `LUIS App ID` field.
* Press the `Start Intent Recognition` button to start recognizing speech intents from your microphone.
  
## Running .html samples
* In case you are hosting the sample on a web server, open a web browser and navigate to the full URL where you host the sample.

> Note: On Safari, the sample web page needs to be hosted on a web server; Safari doesn't allow websites loaded from a local file to use the microphone.
