# Quickstart: Recognize speech in JavaScript on a Web Browser.

These samples demonstrate how to recognize speech using the Speech SDK for JavaScript on a web browser, like Microsoft Edge, or Chrome.

* A PC or Mac, with a working speaker.
* A text editor.
* Optionally, a web server that supports hosting PHP scripts.

## Build the sample

* **By downloading the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK when building this sample, you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license).**
* [Download the sample code to your development PC.](/README.md#get-the-samples)

If you want to host the sample on a web server:

* Deploy all files to your web server.
* IMPORTANT: Never add a subscription key to client-side code. For advanced guidance on keeping sensitive subscription info secure, see the [sample using a server-side auth token](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/js/browser)

## Run the `index.html` sample
