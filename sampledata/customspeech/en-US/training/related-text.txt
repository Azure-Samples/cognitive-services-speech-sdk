For example, you may create a project for call centers that use English in the United States.To create your first project, select the Speech-to-text/Custom speech, then click New Project. Follow the instructions provided by the wizard to create your project. After you've created a project, you should see four tabs: Data, Testing, Training, and Deployment. Use the links provided in Next steps to learn how to use each tab.
Custom Speech provides tools that allow you to visually inspect the recognition quality of a model by comparing audio data with the corresponding recognition result. From the Custom Speech portal, you can play back uploaded audio and determine if the provided recognition result is correct. This tool allows you to quickly inspect quality of Microsoft's baseline speech-to-text model or a trained custom model without having to transcribe any audio data.
