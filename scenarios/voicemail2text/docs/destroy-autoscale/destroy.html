<p>You can destroy V2TIC deployments if you need to make configurartion changes or a pod needs to be deleted. Destroying a deployment deletes the deployment, service, and configmap for that deployment.</p>

<p>
    To a destroy a deployment, in your project, run this command, where <tt>test_deployment</tt> is the name of your deployment:
    <br><br>
    <code>make destroy_pod deployment=test_deployment</code>
</p>
