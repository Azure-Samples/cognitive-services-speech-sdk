<h1>File descriptions</h1>

<p>This is a glossary of the files you'll find and use within the V2TIC repository. To see how these conponents interact, go to <a href="/docs/about/architecture.html">Architecture</a>.</p>

<h2>AcsClient</h2>

<p><tt>AcsClient</tt> processes and sends transcription requests to Azure AI, then receives and processes transcription responses.</p>

<h2>Common folder</h2>

<p>The <tt>Common</tt> folder contains the Python scripts that setup classes, dictionaries, definitions, and more. These handle and process incoming HTTPS and SMTP protocols until the end of delivery of the transcription response.</p>

<h2>etc folder</h2>

<p>
    The <tt>etc</tt> folder contains these folders:
    <ul>
        <li><tt>audio</tt> contains sample audio for testing.</li>
        <li><tt>certs</tt> with certification keys.</li>
        <li><tt>config</tt> with the <tt>config.properties</tt> file. This file contains the global configuration settings specified as key-value pairs for service protocols, as well as ACS specification. Properties set in <tt>configmap-file.yaml</tt> override properties set in <tt>config.properties</tt>. Go to <a href="/docs/reference/deploy-configurations-templates.html">Configuration fields</a> for more information.</li>
        <li><tt>deployments</tt> with .yaml configuration and deployment files for HTTPS and SMTP service protocols:
        <ul>
            <li><tt>configmap-file.yaml</tt>: a configuration file for a Kubernetes resource to store configuration data for service deployments that can be referenced by pods/deployments.</li>
            <li><tt>deployment-file.yaml</tt>: a configuration file for service deployments that defines the container resources and references the configuration data of service deployments in <tt>configmap-file.yaml</tt>.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><tt>profiles</tt>, which contains a set of sample profile, and templates for both HTTPS and SMTP deployments.
        <ul>
            <li><tt>request.j2</tt>: a Jinja template that defines the key-value pairs of the request.</li>
            <li><tt>response.j2</tt>: a Jinja template that defines the key-value pairs of the response.</li>
            <li><tt>profile.py</tt>: a Python script that maps the key-value pairs of the request and response templates.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>sample_server_listeners folder</h2>

<p>This folder contains sample Python programs that can capture final responses during testing for HTTPS and SMTP deployments. Go to <a href="/docs/test-validate/test-validate.html">Test and validate</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>sample_clients folder</h2>

<p>This folder contains sample apps for HTTPS and SMTP deployments. Go to <a href="/docs/build-deploy/build-summary.html">Build and deploy</a> to learn how to run the sample apps.</p>

<h2>servers folder</h2>

<p>The <tt>servers</tt> folder contains both an HTTPS and SMTP server engines to process and handle each type of request.

<h2>v2ticlib folder</h2>

<p>The <tt>v2ticlib</tt> folder contains V2TIC-supported utility Python scripts. You should not need to configure these files.</p>

<h2>Other files</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: a text file to automate build and execution tasks such as building Docker image(s), loading image(s) to minikube, deploying image(s) and running services on pods. Some configuration in <tt>Makefile</tt> is required to build an image. Go to <a href="/docs/reference/configure-makefile.html">Required configuration</a> for more information.</li>
        <li><tt>Dockerfile</tt>: outlines the steps to create the Docker image that includes Ubuntu version 20.04, Python 3.9, and all necessary requirements.</li>
        <li><tt>Requirements.txt</tt>: a list of Python dependencies required to build a Docker image. These are part of the <a href="/docs/about/prerequisites.html">prerequistes</a> for building and deploying V2TIC.</li>
    </ul>
