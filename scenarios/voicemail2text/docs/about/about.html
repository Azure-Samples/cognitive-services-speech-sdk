<h1>About Voicemail to Text Integration Container (V2TIC)</h1>

<p>Voicemail to Text (V2T) is a speech recognition service that transcribes voice messages from a voicemail server into text, allowing the end user to read their voice messages instead of listening to them. </p>

<p>Voicemail to Text Integration Container (V2TIC) is an integration container that emulates existing integrations between voicemail servers and the Nuance-managed Voicemail to Text (V2T) service. Instead of employing on-premises Nuance V2T, the backend recognition technology uses <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services">Azure AI services</a>. This emulation eliminates the need for reintegrating existing voicemail servers to a new transcription service for Nuance V2T clients moving to cloud technologies.</p>

<p>The project contains the files for building and deploying V2TIC, as well as sample files for running basic deployments or to base your own deployments on.</p>

<p>
This documentation is for technical users of existing Nuance V2T integrations, and assumes readers are familiar with the tools and languages used for setting up and deploying V2TIC. Such as:

<ul>
    <li>Developers</li>
    <li>Technical Support Personnel</li>
    <li>System Administrators</li>
</ul>
</p>
    
<p>
Users can assess how to adapt these examples to their own container orchestration framework. 
</p>

<h2>Benefits for end users</h2>

<p>
    V2TIC's benefits to end users include:
    
    <ul>
        <li>No need to write messages down â€“ a paperless environment.</li>
        <li>Read messages in email or visual voicemail applications.</li>
        <li>Automatically capture caller details.</li>
        <li>Screen calls and determine the urgency of a response.</li>
        <li>Reply directly in the same channel.</li>
        <li>React quickly to messages.</li>
        <li>No navigation through voicemail menus.</li>
        <li>Zero maintenance mailbox.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Benefits for partners</h2>

<p>V2TIC is flexible and can quickly and easily be integrated with a broad range of platforms and services. Using HTTPS and TLS v1.3, voice messages are securely transferred to the Azure AI Services (ACS) speech-to-text for processing, with the resulting transcription returned in a secure manner.</p>

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<p>
    Voicemail to Text fits all situations such as:
    
    <ul>
        <li>Discreetly review who called and what they said.</li>
        <li>Easily respond or forward messages to others.</li>
        <li>Never miss an important message while in a meeting or on the phone.</li>
        <li>Manage voicemails the same way you manage your email: file voicemails for future reference, flag for follow up, or mark as spam.</li>
    </ul>
