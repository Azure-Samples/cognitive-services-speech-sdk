   LICENSE ISSUES
   ==============

   The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a double license, i.e. both the conditions of
   the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
   See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
   Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
   please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
