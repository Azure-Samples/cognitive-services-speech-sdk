# Local development instructions

Pre-requisites:
1. Please follow the instructions on [the main guide](./../Setup/guide.md#ingestion-client-setup-instructions) to deploy the Ingestion Client and associated ecosystem to Azure. 
2. Reopen the project within a [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/overview). (The devcontainer settings at the root of the project have the tools needed to develop and run this function locally)

To run the FetchTranscription function locally, do the following:

1. Run the following command to fetch your Azure Function app settings and save them to local.settings.json:

```
func azure functionapp fetch-app-settings <function app name>
```

Note: Replace `<function app name>` with the actual name of your function app that you can get from the Azure Portal. It will look like `FetchTranscriptionFunction-20240531T092901Z`.

2. In the local.settings.json file generated by the previous step, replace the value of the `AzureSpeechServicesKey` with the actual key for your Azure Speech Service instance. You can get this from the Azure portal. (If you're using the SQL database or the Text Analytics, do the same for these keys as well)

3. Navigate to the FetchTranscription function running on your Azure via the portal, and click on Stop. You need to do this so that you don't have two instances of the FetchTranscription function running and listening to the same events when you start the function from your local machine in the next step.

4. Run the following command to start the local function (this will apply your local code changes):

```
func start
```
