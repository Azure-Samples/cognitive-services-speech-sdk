# Examples to use Fast Transcription

The Azure Speech Fast Transcription API is used to transcribe audio files with returning results synchronously and much faster than real-time audio.
This functionality is exposed through a REST API and is easy to access from many programming languages. The samples here do **NOT** require the installation of the Cognitive Service Speech SDK, but use the REST API directly instead.

For a detailed explanation see the [fast transcription documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/fast-transcription-create) and the `README.md` in the language specific subdirectories.

Available samples:

| Language | Directory | Description |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| C# | [csharp](csharp_client) | C# calling fast transcription REST API through System.Net.Http |
| Python | [python](python_client) | Python client calling fast transcription REST API |
| Node.js | [js/node](js_client) | Node.js client calling fast transcription REST API |
