Example in Python on how to use the Speech Services Batch Transcription API.

To execute the sample you need to generate the Python client library.

To do this follow these steps:

1. Go to https://editor.swagger.io
2. Click **File**, then click **Import URL**
3. Enter the Swagger URL including the region for your Speech Services subscription: `https://<your-region>.cris.ai/docs/v2.0/swagger`
4. Click **Generate Client** and select **Python**
5. Save the client library
6. Extract the downloaded python-client-generated.zip somewhere in your file system.
7. Install the extracted python-client module in your python environment using pip: pip install path/to/package/python-client.
8. The installed package has the name swagger_client. You can check that the installation worked using the command `python -c "swagger_client".

You can use a development environment like PyCharm to edit, debug, and execute the sample.
