# Examples to use Batch Transcription

Azure Speech is designed to handle a large number of audio fragments in storage, such as Azure Blobs. The functionality is exposed through a REST API and is easy to access from many programming languages. The samples here do **NOT** require the installation of the Cognitive Service Speech SDK, but use the REST API directly instead.

For a detailed explanation see the [batch transcription documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/batch-transcription) and the `README.md` in the language specific subdirectories.

Available samples:

| Language | Directory | Description |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
