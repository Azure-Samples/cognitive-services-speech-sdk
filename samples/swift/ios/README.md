# Additional samples for Swift on iOS

Theses samples demonstrate more advanced techniques for speech recognition with the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK.
For an introduction to the SDK, please refer to the [quickstart articles for speech recognition](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started-speech-to-text?pivots=programming-languages-objectivec-swift) and [speech synthesis](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started-text-to-speech?pivots=programming-languages-objectivec-swift) on the SDK documentation page for step-by-step instructions.


## Example app with various samples

This [speech sample app](./speech-samples) shows various other techniques, currently only for pronunciation assessment.


## Prerequisites

- A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
- A Mac with Xcode installed as iOS development environment. These samples target iOS versions 11.0 or later.

## Get the code for the samples

- [Download the sample code to your development machine.](/README.md#get-the-samples)

## Get the Speech SDK for iOS

**By downloading the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK, you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license).**

The Cognitive Services Speech SDK for iOS is distributed as a xcframework bundle.
It can be used in Xcode projects as a [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/), or downloaded directly [here](https://aka.ms/csspeech/iosbinary) and linked manually. This guide uses a CocoaPod.

## Install the SDK as a CocoaPod

1. Install the CocoaPod dependency manager as described in its [installation instructions](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
1. Navigate to the directory of the downloaded sample app (e.g. `speech-samples`) in a terminal.
1. Run the command `pod install`. This will generate a Xcode workspace containing both the sample app and the Speech SDK as a dependency. This workspace will be used in the following.

## Build the samples

Open either Xcode project with the sample code.
This loads the project in Xcode.
Next, add your subscription details to the `<sample name>/ViewController.swift` file:

1. Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.
2. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/regions) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

To build the sample app and check if all the paths are set correctly, choose **Product** > **Build** from the menu.

## Run the samples

To run the sample, click the `Play` button, or select **Product** > **Run** from the menu.
In the simulator window that opens, you can interact with the sample application.
