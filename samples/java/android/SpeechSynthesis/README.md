# Speech synthesis sample for Android

This sample demonstrates how to synthesize speech with Java using the Speech SDK for Android.

> **Note:**
> this sample is *not* for the Speech Devices SDK and the Roobo device.
> If you are looking for further information on these, visit the [Speech Devices SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-devices-sdk) page.

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
* A PC (Windows, Linux, Mac) capable to run Android Studio.
* Version 4.2 or higher of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/).
* An ARM-based Android device (API 23: Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher) [enabled for development](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) with a working speaker. Make sure that "USB debugging" is enabled on your device.

## Build the sample

* **By building this sample you will download the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK. By downloading you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license201809).**
* [Download the sample code to your development PC.](/README.md#get-the-samples)
* Open this folder as a project in Android Studio.
* Edit the `MainActivity` source:
  * Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your own subscription key.
  * Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the service region of your subscription.
    For example, replace with `westus` if you are using the 30-day free trial subscription.
* Press Ctrl+F9, or select **Build** \> **Make Project**.

## Run the sample

* Connect your Android device to your development PC.
* Press Shift+F10, or select **Run** \> **Run 'app'**.
* In the deployment target windows that comes up, pick your Android device.
* On your Android device, use the buttons in the user interface to run the sample.

## Note on Android permission handling

Please note that the Speech SDK requires two permissions, i.e., the INTERNET permission. As for Android API levels up to 22, requesting the permissions is handled at installation time but from API level 23 users are able to grant/revoke permissions at any time.

Note that this sample targets minSdkVersion 23 or later, so you need to remove the following code if you want to retarget to minSdkVersion 22 or earlier:

```java
// Note: we need to request the permissions
int requestCode = 5; // Unique code for the permission request
ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(MainActivity.this, new String[]{INTERNET}, requestCode);
```
