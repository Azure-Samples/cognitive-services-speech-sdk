# Embedded speech sample in Java on Android

This sample demonstrates embedded speech using the Speech SDK for Android (Java).
Embedded speech recognition is used as an example. For other use cases (embedded speech synthesis, hybrid speech recognition and synthesis), see the [Java JRE samples](../../jre/embedded-speech).
It is recommended to try them out before this Android specific sample.

Embedded speech enables offline (on-device) speech recognition and synthesis.
Hybrid speech uses cloud speech services by default and embedded speech as a fallback in case cloud connectivity is limited.

> **Note:**
> * Embedded speech is in [preview](https://aka.ms/embedded-speech) and details in this document and samples are subject to change.
> * Embedded speech recognition only supports audio in the following format:
>   * single channel
>   * 8000 or 16000 Hz sample rate
>   * 16-bit little-endian signed integer samples

## Prerequisites

See the [platform requirements for installing the Speech SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform?pivots=programming-language-java).

Requirements specific to this embedded speech sample are as follows.
* Android ARM-based device with **Android 7.0 (API level 24)** or higher, with a working microphone and [enabled for development](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).
* One or more embedded speech recognition models. See https://aka.ms/embedded-speech for the latest information on how to obtain embedded models.

## Build the sample

**By building this sample you will download the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK. By downloading you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license).**

[Download the sample code to your development PC.](/README.md#get-the-samples)

To build:
1. Open the folder containing this sample as a project in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/).
1. Review the `MainActivity` source and update the following settings as necessary:
   * `EmbeddedSpeechRecognitionModelPath`
     * Path to the embedded speech recognition model(s) on the Android device file system.
       This may be a single model folder or a top-level folder for several models.
     * Use an absolute path or a path relative to the application working folder.
       The path is recursively searched for model files.
     * Files belonging to a specific model must be present as normal individual files in a model folder,
       not inside an archive, and they must be readable by the application process.
       The model internal subfolder structure must be intact i.e. as originally delivered.
   * `EmbeddedSpeechRecognitionModelName`
     * Name of the embedded speech recognition model to be used for recognition.
     * The model name can be short (see https://aka.ms/speech/sr-languages, e.g. `en-US`) or full (e.g. `Microsoft Speech Recognizer en-US FP Model V8`).
   * `EmbeddedSpeechRecognitionModelKey`
     * Decryption key of the (encrypted) embedded speech recognition model.
1. Press **Ctrl+F9** or select **Build** \> **Make Project**.

Note: If the build is successful but Android Studio shows references to Speech SDK symbols in red and displays "*Cannot resolve symbol ...*", delete `.gradle` and `.idea` folders, then rebuild.

## Run the sample

1. Connect your Android device to your development PC.
1. Copy the embedded speech recognition model(s) of your choice to the Android device, under a path as configured in the app.
1. In Android Studio, press **Shift+F10** or select **Run** \> **Run 'app'**.
   * If a deployment target window comes up, select your Android device.
1. On the Android device, allow all requested permissions for the app when asked.
   * The sample app depends on the `requestLegacyExternalStorage` attribute for access to files on the external storage.
     This access method will not work if the application specifies a target API level 30 (Android 11) or higher.
     See https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage for information on alternatives.
1. Press the button in the app to recognize speech from the device microphone.

## Remarks

For a new project from scratch, add [client-sdk-embedded](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech/client-sdk-embedded) (`.aar`) as a dependency.
This package supports cloud, embedded, and hybrid speech.
Do **not** add [client-sdk](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech/client-sdk) in the same project, it supports only cloud speech services.

**Note:** Make sure that `@aar` suffix is used when the dependency is specified in `build.gradle`. For example,
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech:client-sdk-embedded:1.26.0@aar'
    ...
```
