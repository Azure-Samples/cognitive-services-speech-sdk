# Embedded speech samples in C++

These samples demonstrate embedded and hybrid speech using the Speech SDK for C++.

Embedded speech enables offline (on-device) speech recognition, synthesis, and translation.
Hybrid speech uses cloud speech services by default and embedded speech as a fallback in case cloud connectivity is limited.

> **Note:**
> * Embedded speech is in [preview](https://aka.ms/embedded-speech) and details in this document and samples are subject to change.
> * Embedded speech recognition and translation only support audio in the following format:
>   * single channel
>   * 8000 or 16000 Hz sample rate
>   * 16-bit little-endian signed integer samples

## Prerequisites

See the [platform requirements for installing the Speech SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform?pivots=programming-language-cpp).
Requirements specific to embedded speech samples are as follows.
* Supported operating systems and architectures:
  * Windows - `x64`, `ARM64`.
  * Linux - `x64`, `ARM64`. Note that embedded speech is not supported on RHEL/CentOS 7.
  * macOS - `x64`, `ARM64`.
* If using Visual Studio (Windows):
  * [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or newer](https://www.visualstudio.com/).
* If using the command line:
  * Latest [NuGet client tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools#nugetexe-cli) (requires [Mono framework](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)). Old NuGet versions included with some Linux distributions cannot restore dependencies in the sample project properly.
* For speech recognition or translation:
  * A working microphone device (and permission to access it for audio capture).
  * One or more embedded speech recognition or translation models. See https://aka.ms/embedded-speech for the latest information on how to obtain embedded models.
* For speech synthesis:
  * A working speaker device (and permission to access it for audio playback).
  * One or more embedded speech synthesis voices. See https://aka.ms/embedded-speech for the latest information on how to obtain embedded voices.
* For hybrid speech recognition or synthesis:
  * A subscription key for the cloud speech service. [Try the speech service for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).

## Build the sample

**By building this sample you will download the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK. By downloading you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license).**

[Download the sample code to your development PC.](/README.md#get-the-samples)

Download example data (a keyword recognition model, speech recognition input files) used in this sample project from
https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/drop/SamplesData/embedded_speech_samples_data.zip.
Unzip the package under this sample folder. The result should be a `data` subfolder with the following files:
```
data\keyword_computer.table
data\speech_test.raw
data\speech_test.wav
```

To tailor the sample to your configuration, there are two options:
* Edit `settings.cpp` before building the sample and update the values of the settings listed below.
* Alternatively set corresponding environment variables (shown in parentheses in the list) before running the sample application. See details in [how to run the sample](#run-the-sample).

Sample settings:
1. `SpeechRecognitionLocale` (`SPEECH_RECOGNITION_LOCALE`)
   * Speech recognition locale in BCP-47 format, case-sensitive. If not set, en-US will be assumed.
   * Setting `EmbeddedSpeechRecognitionModelName` overrides this for embedded speech.
1. `SpeechSynthesisLocale` (`SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_LOCALE`)
   * Speech synthesis locale in BCP-47 format, case-sensitive. If not set, en-US will be assumed.
   * Setting `EmbeddedSpeechSynthesisVoiceName` overrides this for embedded speech.
1. `EmbeddedSpeechRecognitionModelPath` (`EMBEDDED_SPEECH_RECOGNITION_MODEL_PATH`)
   * Path to the local embedded speech recognition model(s) on the device file system.
     This may be a single model folder or a top-level folder for several models.
   * Use an absolute path or a path relative to the application working folder.
     The path is recursively searched for model files.
   * Files belonging to a specific model must be present as normal individual files in a model folder,
     not inside an archive, and they must be readable by the application process.
     The model internal subfolder structure must be intact i.e. as originally delivered.
1. `EmbeddedSpeechRecognitionModelName` (`EMBEDDED_SPEECH_RECOGNITION_MODEL_NAME`)
   * Name of the embedded speech recognition model to be used for recognition. If set, this overrides `SpeechRecognitionLocale` for embedded.
   * The model name can be short (see https://aka.ms/speech/sr-languages, e.g. `en-US`) or full (e.g. `Microsoft Speech Recognizer en-US FP Model V8`).
1. `EmbeddedSpeechRecognitionModelKey` (`EMBEDDED_SPEECH_RECOGNITION_MODEL_KEY`)
   * Decryption key of the (encrypted) embedded speech recognition model.
1. `EmbeddedSpeechSynthesisVoicePath` (`EMBEDDED_SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_VOICE_PATH`)
   * Path to the local embedded speech synthesis voice(s) on the device file system.
     This may be a single voice folder or a top-level folder for several voices.
   * Use an absolute path or a path relative to the application working folder.
     The path is recursively searched for voice files.
   * Files belonging to a specific voice must be present as normal individual files in a voice folder,
     not inside an archive, and they must be readable by the application process.
     The voice internal subfolder structure must be intact i.e. as originally delivered.
1. `EmbeddedSpeechSynthesisVoiceName` (`EMBEDDED_SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_VOICE_NAME`)
   * Name of the embedded speech synthesis voice to be used for synthesis. If set, this overrides `SpeechSynthesisLocale` for embedded.
   * The voice name can be short (see https://aka.ms/speech/tts-languages, e.g. `en-US-JennyNeural`) or full (e.g. `Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, JennyNeural)`).
1. `EmbeddedSpeechSynthesisVoiceKey` (`EMBEDDED_SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_VOICE_KEY`)
   * Decryption key of the (encrypted) embedded speech synthesis voice.
1. `EmbeddedSpeechTranslationModelPath` (`EMBEDDED_SPEECH_TRANSLATION_MODEL_PATH`)
   * Path to the local embedded speech translation model(s) on the device file system.
     This may be a single model folder or a top-level folder for several models.
   * Use an absolute path or a path relative to the application working folder.
     The path is recursively searched for model files.
   * Files belonging to a specific model must be present as normal individual files in a model folder,
     not inside an archive, and they must be readable by the application process.
     The model internal subfolder structure must be intact i.e. as originally delivered.
1. `EmbeddedSpeechTranslationModelName` (`EMBEDDED_SPEECH_TRANSLATION_MODEL_NAME`)
   * Name of the embedded speech translation model to be used for translation.
   * The full model name must be given (e.g. `Microsoft Speech Translator Multi-to-en-US Model V1`).
1. `EmbeddedSpeechTranslationModelKey` (`EMBEDDED_SPEECH_TRANSLATION_MODEL_KEY`)
   * Decryption key of the (encrypted) embedded speech translation model.
1. `CloudSpeechSubscriptionKey` (`CLOUD_SPEECH_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`)
   * Cloud speech service subscription key. This is needed with hybrid speech configuration. If not set, only embedded speech will be used.
1. `CloudSpeechServiceRegion` (`CLOUD_SPEECH_SERVICE_REGION`)
   * Cloud speech service region. This is needed with hybrid speech configuration. If not set, only embedded speech will be used.

### Visual Studio (Windows)

* Start Microsoft Visual Studio and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
* Navigate to the folder containing this sample, and select the solution file `samples.sln` contained within it.
* Set the active solution configuration and platform to the desired values under **Build** \> **Configuration Manager**.
* Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.
  * If you are seeing red squigglies from IntelliSense for Speech SDK APIs, right-click into your editor window and select **Rescan** > **Rescan Solution** to resolve.
  * If there is an error "*Could not find a part of the path*" while Speech SDK packages are installed, copy/move this sample folder to the storage drive root or close to it, so that folder and file paths become shorter.

### Command-line (Linux, macOS)

* Open a `bash` or compatible shell (on macOS, launch **Terminal**), navigate to the folder containing this sample, and run commands
  ```sh
  nuget restore samples.sln
  for nupkg in packages/Microsoft.*/*.nupkg ; do unzip -o $nupkg -d SpeechSDK ; done
  ```
* Edit `Makefile` in the same folder and update
  * SPEECHSDK_ROOT to the full path of the `SpeechSDK` folder that was created in the previous step.
  * TARGET_PLATFORM, in case the default value does not match your platform (see `SpeechSDK/runtimes` created in the previous step).
* Run `make`
* If there are no errors, set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux) or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (macOS) according to instructions in `make` output.

## Run the sample

### Visual Studio

* To debug the sample application and then run it, press F5 or use **Debug** \> **Start Debugging**.
* To run the application without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or use **Debug** \> **Start Without Debugging**.
* If you didn't update `settings.cpp` or want to override built-in settings:
  * Open menu **Debug** \> **samples Debug Properties**.
  * Navigate to **Configuration Properties** \> **Debugging** \> **Environment**.
  * Click to open a pull-down menu, select **Edit...**.
  * Add environment settings (`name=value`) as listed in [build instructions](#build-the-sample).
    For example:
    ```sh
    CLOUD_SPEECH_SERVICE_REGION=westus
    ```
    Notes:
    * Make sure that each `name=value` appears on a separate line.
    * Do not use quotation marks around the values.
    * Environment variables set in this way are only in effect when the solution configuration is **Debug**.
    * The settings are stored in plain text in a new `samples.vcxproj.user` file in the project directory.
* If you want to run sample scenarios that depend on the example `data` files:
  * Open menu **Debug** \> **samples Debug Properties**.
  * Navigate to **Configuration Properties** \> **Debugging** \> **Working Directory**.
  * Replace `$(ProjectDir)` with `$(SolutionDir)`.

The application displays a menu that you can navigate using your keyboard.
Choose the scenarios that you are interested in.

### Command-line

On Windows, navigate to the folder that contains the generated executable according to the solution configuration and platform (for example, `x64\Release` under this sample folder), and run `samples.exe`.

On Linux and macOS, run the generated executable which is named according to TARGET_PLATFORM in `Makefile`. For example:
```sh
./samples-linux-x64
```

**Note:** On **macOS**, if you get a message
"*libMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.(...).dylib can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software*" or similar,
follow instructions in https://support.apple.com/HT202491 (see "*If you want to open an app that hasn't been notarized or is from an unidentified developer*") to allow opening the file.

If you didn't update `settings.cpp` or want to override built-in settings, set environment variables as listed in [build instructions](#build-the-sample) before running the sample application. For example:

**Windows**
```sh
set CLOUD_SPEECH_SERVICE_REGION=westus
```
**Note:** On Windows, do **not** use quotation marks around the values of environment variables (even if there are spaces in them). Otherwise the quotation marks will end up as part of the setting values which will not work.

**Linux, macOS**
```sh
export CLOUD_SPEECH_SERVICE_REGION="westus"
```
**Note:** On Linux and macOS, use quotation marks around the values of environment variables set on the command line as shown in the example. Otherwise strings with spaces (like embedded speech model/voice names) will be cut short.
