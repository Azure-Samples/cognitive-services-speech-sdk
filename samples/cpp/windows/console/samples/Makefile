# Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK - Samples for C++
#
# Check out https://aka.ms/csspeech for documentation.
#
# To compile on Linux using this Makefile, follow instructions similar to the ones
# documented for the C++ Linux Quickstart at:
# https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/master/quickstart/cpp/linux/from-microphone/README.md
#
# You will also need to install the NLOHMANN JSON package ("JSON for Modern C++") as one of the samples
# needs to parse a JSON string containing detailed recognition results. The header file /usr/include/nlohmann/json.hpp
# must be present to compile this sample.
#

# Update this path as needed
SPEECHSDK_ROOT:=/change/to/point/to/extracted/SpeechSDK

# If you'd like to build for
# - Linux x86 (32-bit), replace "x64" below with "x86".
# - Linux ARM64 (64-bit), replace "x64" below with "arm64".
# - Linux ARM32 (32-bit), replace "x64" below with "arm32".
# - CentOS 7 x64 (64-bit), replace "x64" below with "centos7-x64".
